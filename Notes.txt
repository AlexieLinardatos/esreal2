Evaluation Metrics & Hallucination detection:

    FAITHSCORE: Likely evaluating faithfulness or factual accuracy.

    pope: Often used for perceptual-oriented performance evaluation.

    Hallucination: Custom scripts or code for detecting hallucinations.

Vision-Language Model Interfaces & Wrappers:

    LAVIS: Commonly used for loading image captioning models like BLIP/InstructBLIP.

    LLaVA: Vision-language instruction-following models.

    mPLUG-Owl2: Multimodal LLM-based vision-language models.

Reinforcement Learning for Optimization:

    trlx: Used for PPO-based reinforcement learning, training optimization, and reward models.
